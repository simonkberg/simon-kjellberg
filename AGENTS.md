# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal website built with Next.js 16 (App Router) that integrates with Slack for real-time chat functionality, WakaTime for coding statistics, and Last.fm for recently played music. The site is deployed as a standalone Docker container on Railway.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24
- Corepack enabled

If Corepack is not enabled, run `corepack enable` before installing dependencies.

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Start Next.js development server with Turbopack
- `pnpm build` - Build production bundle (requires all environment variables to be set)
- `pnpm start` - Start production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier checks in parallel
- `pnpm lint:fix` - Auto-fix ESLint and Prettier issues
- `pnpm lint:eslint` - Run ESLint only
- `pnpm lint:prettier` - Run Prettier check only
- `pnpm lint:tsc` - Run TypeScript type checking (runs typegen first)
- `pnpm test` - Run tests (watch mode only in interactive terminals; runs once and exits in non-TTY environments)
- `pnpm test --coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

### Testing

- Tests are located alongside source files with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extensions
- Test files must be in the `app/` directory to be discovered
- Uses happy-dom as the test environment

**Note for AI agents:** Do not prefix test commands with `CI=true`. Vitest automatically detects non-TTY environments and runs once.

### MCP Tools

MCP servers are configured in `.mcp.json`. Key guidance:

- Use the ESLint MCP tools for linting instead of running `pnpm lint` directly
- For Next.js questions or features, always consult the Next.js documentation via the `nextjs_docs` MCP tool

### Docker

- Build: `docker build -t simon.dev .`
- Run: `docker run -p 3000:3000 simon.dev`

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

- `app/` - Next.js App Router structure (all source code lives here)
    - `actions/` - Server actions for chat, WakaTime, and Last.fm integration
    - `api/` - API routes (e.g., SSE endpoint for real-time chat updates)
    - `components/` - Shared React components (co-located with tests)
    - `lib/` - Utility libraries and core logic
        - `messageParser/` - Slack message parsing with emoji support
    - `assets/` - Static assets (fonts, images)
    - `listening/` - Listening stats page
        - `components/` - Route-specific components (PeriodSelector, TopTracksTable, etc.)

**Note:** Route-specific components live in `{route}/components/` rather than the shared `app/components/` directory. This keeps related code colocated and makes it clear which components are page-specific vs shared.

### Key Technical Details

**Path Aliases:**

- `@/*` maps to `app/*` (configured in tsconfig.json)

**Environment Variables:**
Environment validation is handled via custom Zod validation in `app/lib/env.ts`. Required variables:

- `SESSION_SECRET` - Session encryption secret (auto-defaults to "unsafe_dev_secret" in development)
- `SLACK_CHANNEL` - Slack channel ID
- `SLACK_TOKEN` - Slack API token
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` - Upstash Redis REST API URL
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` - Upstash Redis REST API token
- `LAST_FM_API_KEY` - Last.fm API key for fetching recently played tracks

Set `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true` to allow builds without all environment variables (used in CI/Docker). Configure development environment variables in `.env.local` (per Next.js convention).

**Slack Integration Architecture:**

- Uses both Slack Web API (for reading/posting messages) and RTM API (for real-time subscriptions)
- Message parsing pipeline: `textParser` → `emojiParser` converts Slack-formatted messages to React components
- DataLoader with LRU cache (100 entries) is used to batch and cache user info requests
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint at `/api/chat/sse` streams chat updates to clients
- Emoji data is extracted from `emoji-datasource` package at build time

**WakaTime Integration Architecture:**

- Simple fetch function in `app/lib/wakaTime.ts` retrieves coding statistics
- Uses public share URL (no API key required)
- 3 second timeout on API requests
- Returns language/framework usage percentages
- Zod schema validation for response data

**Last.fm Integration Architecture:**

- Client implementation in `app/lib/lastfm.ts` wraps Last.fm Web Services API
- Fetches recently played tracks via `user.getRecentTracks` method
- Fetches top tracks/artists/albums via `user.getTopTracks`, `user.getTopArtists`, `user.getTopAlbums`
- Supports pagination with `limit` and `page` parameters
- Includes now playing status and loved track indicators
- 3 second timeout on API requests
- Track data includes artist, album, play time, and MusicBrainz IDs
- Period filtering for top stats: `7day`, `1month`, `3month`, `6month`, `12month`, `overall`

**Caching with `"use cache"`:**

- Server actions in `app/actions/lastfm.ts` use the `"use cache"` directive for data caching
- Use `cacheLife("hours")` for successful responses
- Use `cacheLife("seconds")` in catch blocks to avoid caching errors for long periods
- Example pattern:
    ```typescript
    export async function getData(): Promise<Result> {
        "use cache";
        cacheLife("hours");
        try {
            const data = await fetchData();
            return { status: "ok", data };
        } catch (error) {
            cacheLife("seconds"); // Don't cache errors for long
            return { status: "error", error: "Failed to fetch" };
        }
    }
    ```

**Session Management:**

- Sessions use encrypted cookies via `app/lib/session.ts`
- Random usernames are generated using `app/lib/randomName.ts`
- Username-to-color mapping via `app/lib/stringToColor.ts` for consistent UI coloring

**Rate Limiting:**

- Chat messages are rate-limited using Upstash Redis (5 messages per 30 seconds per IP)
- Uses sliding window algorithm for accurate rate limiting
- Lazy initialization pattern for the rate limiter singleton
- Analytics and protection features enabled
- Identifier extraction via `app/lib/identifiers.ts` (IP address and user agent)

**React Compiler:**

- Enabled via `babel-plugin-react-compiler` in Next.js config
- Components are automatically optimized at build time

**TypeScript Configuration:**

- Extremely strict mode enabled (see tsconfig.json)
- Notable strictness: `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` is disabled for better compatibility with optional fields and external libraries
- Always use optional chaining and nullish coalescing when accessing arrays/objects

**Testing Strategy:**

- Tests are co-located with source files
- Uses @testing-library/react for component tests
- Snapshot tests are used for emoji parsing validation
- happy-dom provides a lightweight DOM environment
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) is used for mocking HTTP requests in tests
    - MSW server is set up in `mocks/node.ts` and configured in `vitest.setup.ts`
    - Handlers are automatically reset between tests
    - Import server from `@/mocks/node` to add request handlers in tests
    - Environment variables are mocked in `vitest.config.ts` using a `mockEnv` object

**Testing Best Practices:**

- **Type-safe mocks**: Always use `vi.mock(import("module"), ...)` syntax, never string-based mocks
- **Type imports**: Use `import type { TypeName }` for types, avoid React UMD globals
- **Avoid redundant tests**: Don't test element existence separately if interaction tests already verify it (e.g., a click test inherently verifies the button exists)
- **Separate concerns**: Use separate `describe` blocks for different exports (e.g., metadata vs component)
- **Testing async components with `use()` hook**: Wrap render in `await act(async () => render(...))` to ensure promises resolve before assertions:
    ```typescript
    it("should render data", async () => {
      const result = { status: "ok", data: [...] };
      await act(async () =>
        render(<MyComponent data={Promise.resolve(result)} />),
      );
      expect(screen.getByRole("table")).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    ```

## Common Patterns

**Page Layout and Metadata:**

- Root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) defines metadata template: `%s - Simon Kjellberg`
- Subpages only need to set `title: "PageName"` and the template adds the suffix
- `Page` component accepts optional `section` prop for header display (`#!/Simon Kjellberg/Section`)
- `global-error.tsx` and `global-not-found.tsx` don't inherit the layout template, so they must include the full title

**Promise Props with `use()` Hook (React 19):**

- Components can accept Promise props and unwrap them with the `use()` hook
- This enables streaming: parent passes promise, child renders when resolved
- Works in both Server and Client Components (only `async/await` is Server Component only)
- Wrap in Suspense for loading states:

    ```typescript
    // Page passes promise
    <Suspense fallback={<Loader />}>
      <DataTable data={fetchData()} />
    </Suspense>

    // Component unwraps with use()
    "use client";
    const DataTable = ({ data }: { data: Promise<Data> }) => {
      const result = use(data);
      return <table>...</table>;
    };
    ```

**Server-Only Code:**
Files that should never run on the client must import `"server-only"` at the top (e.g., `app/lib/slack.ts`, `app/lib/session.ts`).

**Server Actions:**
All server actions are in `app/actions/` and marked with `"use server"` directive. They return discriminated unions with `status: "ok" | "error"` for type-safe error handling.

**Message Parsing:**
Slack messages are processed through a two-stage pipeline:

1. `textParser` - Handles text formatting (links, mentions, etc.)
2. `emojiParser` - Converts emoji codes to React components with skin tone support
